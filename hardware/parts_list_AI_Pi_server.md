V4 Detailed Parts List Report for Raspberry Pi 5 AI Advanced Home Server

This V4 report updates V3 to include two value-focused external GPUs (used AMD RX 460, ~$50-80 each; selected for reliability on Pi 5 with minimal hacks beyond initial kernel patches—boosts AI capabilities like OCR/inference by 5-10x via amdgpu driver). Preparation in initial build (e.g., PCIe adapter, pre-patched kernel) enables relatively seamless addition: Plug GPU into OCuLink, reboot, and use—hacks are one-time (config.txt enablement, driver compile), not "death by hacks." Ownership reflects full inventory. Prices from 2025 sources (eBay/Amazon used for GPUs; official for others).



Total cost for non-owned: Minimum core ~$340 (Pi 5, AI Kit, PCIe, GPUs); Full ~$450-550.
